Submitting the paper "An Advanced Approach of Local Counter Synchronization"

Dear sir / madam
I am very happy to propose an novel method to enhance timestamp ordering algorithm in distributed concurrency control in the submitted paper "An Advanced Approach of Local Counter Synchronization in Timestamp Ordering Algorithm in Distributed Concurrency Control". Following is abstract of this paper:

"Concurrency control is the problem that database management system (DBMS) meets with difficulties, especially distributed DBMS. There are two main methods of concurrency control such as locking-based and timestamp-based. Each method gets involved in its own disadvantages but locking-based approach is often realized in most distributed DBMS because its feasibility and strictness lessen danger in distributed environment. Otherwise, timestamp ordering algorithm is merely implemented in central DBMS due to the issue of local counter synchronization among sites in distributed environment. The common solution is broadcasting the message about the change of local counter (at one site) over distributed network so that all remaining sites “know” to update their own counters. However this solution raises some disadvantages of low performance. So I propose an advanced approach to overcome such disadvantages by giving out another measure so-called active number that is responsible for harmonizing local counters among distributed sites. Moreover I propose a method to apply minimum spanning tree into reduce cost of broadcasting messages over distributed network."

Submitting the paper "Estimating Peak Bone Mineral Density by Maximum Distribution"

Dear sir / madam
I am very happy to propose an novel method to estimate peak bone mineral density in the submitted paper "Estimating Peak Bone Mineral Density in Osteoporosis Diagnosis by Maximum Distribution". Following is abstract of this paper:

"The T-score is very important to diagnosis of osteoporosis and its formula is calculated from two parameters such as peak bone mineral density (pBMD) and variance of pBMD. This research proposes a new method to estimate these parameters with the recognition that pBMD conforms maximum distributions, for example, Gumbel distribution. Firstly, our method models bone mineral density (BMD) data collected in research as a series of maximum values and such values are assumed to obey Gumbel distribution. Secondly, we apply moment technique to estimate the mean and variance of Gumbel distribution with regard to the series of maximum values. These mean and variance are adjusted to become the best estimated pBMD and variance of pBMD. There is no normality assumption in this research because pBMD is essentially the extreme value with low frequency in population and so the estimate of pBMD will be more accurate if we take full advantage of specific characteristics of Gumbel maximum distribution."

Submitting the paper "A new aware-context collaborative filtering approach"

Dear sir / madam
I am very happy to propose an novel method for aware-context collaborative filtering in the submitted paper "A new aware-context collaborative filtering approach by applying multivariate logistic regression model into general user pattern". Following is abstract of this paper:

Traditional collaborative filtering (CF) does not take into account contextual factors such as time, place, companion, environment, etc which are useful information around users or relevant to recommender application. So recent aware-context CF takes advantages of such information in order to improve the quality of recommendation. There are three main aware-context approaches: contextual pre-filtering, contextual post-filtering and contextual modeling. Each approach has individual strong points and drawbacks but there is a requirement of steady and fast inference model which supports to aware-context recommendation process.
This paper proposes a new approach which discovers multivariate logistic regression model by mining both traditional rating data and contextual data. Logistic model is optimal inference model in response to the binary question “whether or not a user prefers a list of recommendations with regard to contextual condition”. Consequently, such regression model is used as a filter to remove irrelevant items from recommendations. The final list is the best recommendations to be given to users under contextual information. Moreover the searching items space of logistic model is reduced to smaller set of items so-called general user pattern (GUP). GUP supports logistic model to be faster in real-time response.
