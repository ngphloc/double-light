Dear Sir/Madam
I am Loc Nguyen who is author of two manuscripts as follows:
1. Manuscript JMSS-E20130701-02 is entitled "A Maximum Likelihood Mixture Approach for Multivariate Hypothesis Testing in case of Incomplete" 
2. Manuscript JMSS-E20130701-03 is entitled "A new method to determine separated hyper-plane for non-parametric sign test in multivariate data". 

They are accepted to be published in our journal Journal of Mathematics and System Science on July 21, 2013 and August 1, 2013 but I have not made payment yet. The payment fees for these articles are $300 and $678 (with 10%discount and $60/page).
Now I have just revised two manuscript so that they are better.
The page length of the manuscript JMSS-E20130701-02 is not changed (12 pages) but the page length of manuscript JMSS-E20130701-03 is extended to 8 pages (its old page length is 6).

I desire to publish them in our journal because they are very important to my research career. This is my biggest honor and happiness.
Therefore, please help me to re-calculate the new payment charges on these manuscripts.

I am waiting for your response.
The attached includes these revised manuscripts and reviewers' comments.
Best regards,
